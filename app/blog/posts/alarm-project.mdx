For the university project in “Human-Computer Interaction,”
the task involves developing an alarm clock with added value,
incorporating a unique feature that addresses an additional user need beyond
simply waking them up. This design encourages positive behaviors or solves a specific problem,
enhancing the waking experience.

#### An Added Value Alarm

The project aims to stand out in a saturated alarm clock market by focusing on
a specific target group that benefits from a solution tailored to a particular issue.
We chose to address the problem of morning dehydration. Research shows that a significant
percentage of people wake up dehydrated, experiencing symptoms like fatigue, difficulty concentrating
and muscle cramps.

#### The target audience

The project’s target audience includes individuals who want to start their
day with a healthy habit. The device encourages drinking water first thing
in the morning, integrating rehydration into their routine in a simple and natural way.

#### Interactions

The project includes several simple interactions between the user and the device:

- Alarm and LED: When the alarm sounds, a white LED lights up, indicating the glass’s
  location to help users find it easily, even in the dark.
- Turning Off the Alarm: When the user lifts the glass, the LED changes
  from white to green, visually confirming that the action was successful.
- Audio Feedback: A brief sound confirms that the alarm has been turned off,
  providing immediate feedback on the interaction.

#### App design

A simple and intuitive app has been designed to enable seamless interaction with the device.
The app features a clear interface, making it easy to set the alarm and track hydration habits.

#### Conclusion

The project defined a target audience and addressed morning dehydration
as a key issue. The result is a unique alarm clock concept that promotes healthy
hydration habits from the start of the day.
